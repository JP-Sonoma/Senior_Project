# Senior Design Project 2023-2024
The project given to use was to create a control system for a quadcopter and run it on an FPGA for hardware acceleration.

## Weights
This folder holds all the weights developed for running YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 on the PYNQ Board.

## Notebooks
This folder holds all the notebooks to run code on the PYNQ board. Its expected that the PYNQ board has an image of [PYNQ](https://www.pynq.io/boards.html) framework added onto it. All current progress will be recorded here in a [readme.md file](https://github.com/JP-Sonoma/Senior_Project/blob/main/notebooks/README.md).
